## Install basic softwares for your development environment
Installing Hexo is quite easy. However, you do need to have a couple of other things installed first:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ "访问NodeJs官方主页")
- [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/download/ "访问git下载地址")

## Install Hexo Plugin
If your computer already has these, congratulations! Just install Hexo with npm:
``` console 
npm install hexo-cli -g
```
## Test & init your blog 
open Git Bash and switch to any one floder you want e.g. D:/, and run below commands
``` console
$ hexo init blog 
$ cd blog
$ npm install 
$ hexo server // start your local server and it will listen port at 4000 
```
visit localhost:4000 when all above are done.
